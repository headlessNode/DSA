# Recursion

This folder contains various implementations of recursion in different algorithms using C++. Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

## Algorithms

### 1. Calculating Factorial

- File: `factorial_recursion.cpp`

This algorithm calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. It demonstrates a simple example of recursion where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem.

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence with Recursion and Memoization

- Files: `fibonacci_recursion.cpp` and `fibonacci_memoization.cpp`

These algorithms compute the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. The `fibonacci_recursion.cpp` file uses a straightforward recursive approach, while the `fibonacci_memoization.cpp` file employs memoization to improve efficiency by storing previously calculated results.

### 3. Head Recursion and Tail Recursion

- Files: `head_recursion.cpp` and `tail_recursion.cpp`

The `head_recursion.cpp` file demonstrates head recursion, where the recursive call is made before any other processing in the function. Conversely, the `tail_recursion.cpp` file shows tail recursion, where the recursive call is made at the end of the function, typically with the accumulation of intermediate results.

### 4. Nested Recursion

- File: `nested_recursion.cpp`

This algorithm showcases nested recursion, where a recursive function passes the result of the recursive call as an argument to another recursive call.

### 5. Indirect Recursion

- File: `indirect_recursion.cpp`

The `indirect_recursion.cpp` file exemplifies indirect recursion, which occurs when multiple functions call each other in a circular manner.

### 6. Tree Recursion

- File: `tree_recursion.cpp`

This algorithm demonstrates tree recursion, where a function makes more than one recursive call during its execution, leading to a branching structure resembling a tree.

### 7. Calculating Power using Recursion

- File: `power_recursion.cpp`

The `power_recursion.cpp` file calculates the power of a given number using recursion. It showcases how recursion can be applied to solve problems related to exponentiation efficiently.

### 8. Taylor Series using Recursion

- File: `taylorseries_recursion.cpp`

This algorithm computes the Taylor series expansion of a mathematical function using recursion. It illustrates how recursion can be used to approximate complex functions through iterative summation.

### 9. Tower of Hanoi using Recursion

- File: `towerOfHanoi_recursion.cpp`

The `towerOfHanoi_recursion.cpp` file presents a recursive solution to the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. It demonstrates how recursion can be utilized to solve complex problems involving mathematical or logical patterns.

Feel free to explore these files to understand and experiment with different recursion techniques and their applications. Each file contains comments and code explanations to guide you through the implementation.
