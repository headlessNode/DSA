# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains a collection of code snippets that reflect my journey of learning data structures and algorithms in C++. Each folder represents a different topic and includes code examples and explanations to help others understand and learn from my progress.

## Data Structures

- LinkedList
- Binary Tree
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure folder contains implementation files written in C++ and includes a README file with explanations and examples of usage.

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

Similarly, each algorithm folder includes C++ implementation files and a README with explanations and example code.
